    text: "A new exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry lets visitors grasp the hands-on and present possibilities of wearable technologies and think of the spectacular possibilities ahead. “Wired to Wear” weaves together design, engineering and art from 15 different countries, brands like Google and applied technology from the University of Illinois at Chicago. Anthony Vitagliano, who runs exhibitions and engagement at MSI, said “Wired to Wear” is the world’s first exhibition on wearable technology “from backpacks to jetpacks.” (Indeed, a man with the latter flew over MSI’s north entrance in a press event to launch the exhibition.)"

Then the scream of four miniature jet engines tore across the courtyard in front of the Museum of Science and Industry, Browning’s 5-foot-9 frame lifted off the ground and he — along with his 55-pound “jet suit” — hurtled toward 100 or so awestruck spectators Thursday morning. “It’s OK. You can take off the headphones now,” Browning said a few moments later, the air rippling behind him as he cut the engines, which resembled four black telescopic camera lenses jutting out from his wrists."

During a UIC human augmentics class Victor Mateevitsi, Brad Haggadone and Brian Kunzer were asked to do one thing: Make something that can see the invisible. What developed was SpiderSense, a wearable suit with 15 modules placed all around a person’s body that applies pressure when someone is approaching an object."

The suit, which allows users to sense obstacles without seeing them, was featured as “Wearable Tech” in National Geographic’s Weird But True! Ripped from the Headlines Summer 2014 edition. SpiderSense has seven sensor modules placed on the body: two on the wrists, two on the chest and one each on the back, shoulders and head. The sensors use echolocation — which bats have to navigate in the dark — and apply pressure when something is nearby."

A new line of clothing that incorporates tiny, flexible LEDs right into jackets and dresses could be the first fully controllable electronic clothing that’s ready for the shop rack. The collection, called Lüme, was shown last week at the International Symposium on Wearable Computers in Zurich, Switzerland. It consists of a bomber jacket, a tunic, and an open-backed dress – all of which have controllable LEDs built-in that can be controlled by a smartphone app. The LEDs are enmeshed in fabric so they don’t touch the wearer’s skin, and they shine out through several layers of fabric that diffuse the light for a softer glow."

    title: Virtual reality display lets fire crews see in blaze
    text: "When firefighters enter a burning building, they usually go in blind. Smoke often shrouds their view and it can be hard to know exactly where they are, or where the fire is. A virtual reality project called ProFiTex at the Vienna University of Technology in Austria is attempting to change that by giving firefighters a head-up display which helps them navigate in the dark. The system uses head-mounted infrared sensors that overlay surface temperatures onto the display, which also shows a 3D model of the surroundings created by a head-mounted depth camera. This gives firefighters an idea of how hot their surroundings are, whether it is safe to enter a room and the layout of the rooms in front of them."

    text: "STEP into the labyrinth. Imagine physically wandering through the many rooms and corridors of an endless maze, never seeing the same place twice – but without actually leaving your living room. This is the promise of a new virtual reality (VR) system. It works by tracking the body and head movements of a person wearing a VR headset and guides them through endless sets of virtual spaces as they pace around within a real physical space. The trick is that, in the virtual world, the corridors and rooms are generated automatically as the walker moves to always fit inside the real space available. There is potentially no end to the environment, just like a huge video game."

    text: "Have you ever wanted superpowers? Students at the University of Illinois at Chicago have built a suit mimicking Spider-Man’s “SpiderSense” by using sensory receptors to “feel” their environment. The students in the computer science, communication and bioengineering departments were broken up into groups and charged with the task of making something that could “see the invisible.” Victor Mateevitsi said that he and his classmates were looking for a way to supplement the existing human senses, to fill in the blind spots. “There are a lot of things that are invisible, but are deadly to us. Or, they may be a possible threat to us,” he said. “For example, radiation has no taste, it doesn’t emit any sound, yet it is extremely deadly. So we started playing around with the idea of what are the things that are invisible and how can we communicate them to the user without the need of a phone or a device that you need to take out of your pocket and look at.”"

W przypadku komiksowego bohatera Peta'a Parkera, czyli Spider-Mana, charakterystyczne swędzenie uprzedzało superbohatera o zagrożeniu. Namiastkę tej nadprzyrodzonej zdolności może dać każdemu założenie specjalnego ubioru, pozwalającego odczuwać obecność najbliższych obiektów. Dzięki niemu można poruszać się w całkowitej ciemności."

    title: High-tech Spider-Man suit gives you real-life 'spidey sense'
    text: "Scientist Victor Mateevitsi of the University of Illinois in Chicago has invented every comic book fan's ultimate fantasy: a body suit that grants its wearer the powers of Spider-Man, reports New Scientist. Mateevitsi's suit has the amazing ability to \"tingle\" whenever an object gets too close, effectively mimicking Spider-Man's famous \"spidey sense\" that warns him of danger. The suit, which is actually called SpiderSense, is so sensitive that users can even navigate a room with their eyes closed."

    title: "We can all be Peter Parker: New suit gives wearer 'SpiderSense'"
    text: "As all comic fans know, what makes Spider-Man successful at this superhero schtick is because he’s known for more than the whole sticking-to-walls thing he’s named after. No, it’s all the other powers and abilities that he gained at the same time (or invented; where would Spidey be without his webbing, after all?): The proportionate strength, the increased agility and… oh, yeah, the Spider-Sense. Now, a scientist from the University of Illinois in Chicago has built a suit that mimics that last ability for its wearers, taking us one step closer to our own crime-fighting futures. As if to make the inspiration for his suit particularly clear, creator Victor Mateevitsi even named it “SpiderSense,” and described ways in which it could turn anybody into Peter Parker’s alter-ego – well, at least partially."

    title: SpiderSense-pak laat je je omgeving voelen
    text: "Het SpiderSense pak is geïnspireerd op Spider-Man die een tinteling voelt als een hij wordt bedreigd wordt door gevaar, bijvoorbeeld als iemand hem wil slaan. De superheld kan daarmee de slagen ontwijken. Wellicht dat we dat in de nabije toekomst net zo kunnen voelen door een SpiderSense-pak te dragen. Het pak is uitgerust met een zeven miniscule robotarmpjes en microfoons die ultrasoon geluid uitzenden en de reflectie van dat geluid op dichtstbijzijnde objecten weer opvangt. Zodra iets in de buurt komt zullen de robotarmpjes een lichte druk op het lichaam uitvoeren zodat je voelt waar de bedreiging vandaan komt."

    title: Η στολή του Spiderman που σε κάνει… spiderman!
    text: "Ο Victor Mateevitsi από το Πανεπιστήμιο του Ιλινόις κατάφερε και δημιούργησε τη στολή με ονομασία SpiderSense, η οποία ενσωματώνει ρομποτικούς βραχίονες με μικρόφωνα τα οποία μπορούν να στέλνουν και να λαμβάνουν υπερηχητικές ανακλάσεις από τα τριγύρω αντικείμενα. Όταν ένα μικρόφωνο αντιληφθεί ένα αντικείμενο κοντά, τότε η στολή ανταποκρίνεται στέλνοντας μία πίεση προς το σώμα και κατευθύνοντας το προς το στόχο. Η κάλυψη των 360 μοιρών προσδίδεται με τη χρήση 7 μικροφώνων."
