    title: "Can artificial intelligence help scientists spot gravitational waves?"
    text: "Scientists hunting for elusive gravitational waves across the universe may be able to supercharge their discoveries with a new tool: artificial intelligence. Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime, created when a massive object is accelerated or disturbed, such as when a black hole and a neutron star collide. Theorized by Albert Einstein, their existence was confirmed in 2015 with the first gravitational wave discovery by researchers using LIGO (the advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory). Now, just six years later, there have been at least 50 gravitational wave events detected."

Anthony Vitagliano, who runs exhibitions and engagement at MSI, said \"Wired to Wear\" is the world's first exhibition on wearable technology \"from backpacks to jetpacks.\" (Indeed, a man with the latter flew over MSI's north entrance in a press event to launch the exhibition.)"

Then the scream of four miniature jet engines tore across the courtyard in front of the Museum of Science and Industry, Browning’s 5-foot-9 frame lifted off the ground and he — along with his 55-pound “jet suit” — hurtled toward 100 or so awestruck spectators Thursday morning. “It’s OK. You can take off the headphones now,” Browning said a few moments later, the air rippling behind him as he cut the engines, which resembled four black telescopic camera lenses jutting out from his wrists."

A new line of clothing that incorporates tiny, flexible LEDs right into jackets and dresses could be the first fully controllable electronic clothing that’s ready for the shop rack.

It consists of a bomber jacket, a tunic, and an open-backed dress – all of which have controllable LEDs built-in that can be controlled by a smartphone app. The LEDs are enmeshed in fabric so they don’t touch the wearer’s skin, and they shine out through several layers of fabric that diffuse the light for a softer glow."

    title: Virtual reality display lets fire crews see in blaze
    text: "When firefighters enter a burning building, they usually go in blind. Smoke often shrouds their view and it can be hard to know exactly where they are, or where the fire is. A virtual reality project called ProFiTex at the Vienna University of Technology in Austria is attempting to change that by giving firefighters a head-up display which helps them navigate in the dark. The system uses head-mounted infrared sensors that overlay surface temperatures onto the display, which also shows a 3D model of the surroundings created by a head-mounted depth camera. This gives firefighters an idea of how hot their surroundings are, whether it is safe to enter a room and the layout of the rooms in front of them."

Mateevitsi’s SpiderSense, a suit that allows users to sense — without seeing — obstacles around them, recently received worldwide attention. The University of Illinois at Chicago student has now landed a competitive internship at Pixar through the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and Technology Council. Mateevitsi, a graduate student in computer science and research assistant at UIC’s Electronic Visualization Laboratory will work at Pixar in Emeryville, Calif., for 12 weeks beginning in May to develop studio production tools."

    text: "STEP into the labyrinth. Imagine physically wandering through the many rooms and corridors of an endless maze, never seeing the same place twice – but without actually leaving your living room. This is the promise of a new virtual reality (VR) system. It works by tracking the body and head movements of a person wearing a VR headset and guides them through endless sets of virtual spaces as they pace around within a real physical space. The trick is that, in the virtual world, the corridors and rooms are generated automatically as the walker moves to always fit inside the real space available. There is potentially no end to the environment, just like a huge video game."

Students at the University of Illinois at Chicago have built a suit mimicking Spider-Man’s “SpiderSense” by using sensory receptors to “feel” their environment. The students in the computer science, communication and bioengineering departments were broken up into groups and charged with the task of making something that could “see the invisible.” Victor Mateevitsi said that he and his classmates were looking for a way to supplement the existing human senses, to fill in the blind spots. “There are a lot of things that are invisible, but are deadly to us. Or, they may be a possible threat to us,” he said. “For example, radiation has no taste, it doesn’t emit any sound, yet it is extremely deadly. So we started playing around with the idea of what are the things that are invisible and how can we communicate them to the user without the need of a phone or a device that you need to take out of your pocket and look at.”"

SpiderSense is a onesie that uses a series of microphones to rend and receive ultrasonic signals from the space around you, like high frequency radar. When the outfit senses something approaching, a robotic arm corresponding to the microphone exerts pressure on your skin, pointing you in the direction of the danger. Mateevitsi tested the gear by blindfolding researchers and asking them to throw a cardboard ninja star whenever (and wherever) they sensed a threat -- with positive results 95 percent of the time. SpiderSense will get its first public showing at Stuttgart's Augmented Human conference in March and it's hoped that the hardware will eventually help Blind people get around easier."

    title: Body Suit Gives You Real-Life 'Spidey Sense'
    text: "When it comes to recreating Spider-Man’s superpowers, those silly string-blasting, wrist-mounted “web shooter” toys are mere child’s play, at least compared to what Victor Mateevitsi has up his sleeve. Mateevitsi, a computer science grad student at University of Illinois at Chicago, has built a suit called SpiderSense lets you feel the proximity to nearby objects or lunging villains. In fact, it’s so sensitive and tingly that users can navigate with their eyes closed."

    title: Grad Student Creates His Own Working Spider-Man Suit
    text: "Who says you have to get bitten by a radioactive spider to get the power of Spider-Man? One student has used technology to acquire a spidey-sense. Victor Mateevitsi is a a computer science grad student at University of Illinois at Chicago. He hopes his invention, which takes a lot of inspiration from Marvel’s Spider-Man, could have applications for cyclists and the visually impaired. What does his special suit do exactly? It warns the wearer when something is near them. He calls it SpiderSense."

    title: The suit that gives you 'Spidey Sense' just like Spider-Man by tingling when there is impeding danger
    text: "An incredible suit gives anyone the 'Spidey Sense' felt by Peter Parker to alert him to any imminent threat. Just like Spider-Man, anyone who wears the suit can benefit from 360 degree awareness of the environment around their body. It is so sensitive that, in trials, blindfolded wearers armed with cardboard ninja stars were able to score direct hits on anyone who strayed too close."

    title: Spidey-Sense Suit Tingles When Someone Gets Too Close
    text: "FOR Peter Parker, it was a tingling sensation that alerted him to an imminent threat. Now anyone can pretend to be Spider-Man by simply donning a suit that lets you feel how close you are to a nearby object. It can even let the wearer navigate with their eyes closed. The suit, called SpiderSense and built by Victor Mateevitsi of the University of Illinois in Chicago has small robotic arms packaged in modules with microphones that send out and pick up ultrasonic reflections from objects. When the ultrasound detects someone moving closer to the microphone, the arms respond by exerting a growing pressure on the body. Seven of these modules are distributed across the suit to give the wearer as near to 360 degree ultrasound coverage as possible."

    title: Chicago virtual reality lab home to futuristic health class
    text: "Futuristic health care is being conceptualized at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago. EVL uses technology that may be applied to create the futuristic settings for a new UIC class in “Human Augmentics,” the study of merging biology and technology. The course is a look into the future of rehabilitation and monitoring of health habits. It creates projects in a group setting to create prototype devices that aid or monitor a person’s health or health habits in ways that their biology may not."
