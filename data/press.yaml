    title: ‘Wired to Wear’ opens at MSI
    text: "A new exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry lets visitors grasp the hands-on and present possibilities of wearable technologies and think of the spectacular possibilities ahead. “Wired to Wear” weaves together design, engineering and art from 15 different countries, brands like Google and applied technology from the University of Illinois at Chicago. Anthony Vitagliano, who runs exhibitions and engagement at MSI, said “Wired to Wear” is the world’s first exhibition on wearable technology “from backpacks to jetpacks.” (Indeed, a man with the latter flew over MSI’s north entrance in a press event to launch the exhibition.)"

    title: Real-life Iron Man opens Museum of Science and Industry ‘Wired to Wear’ exhibit
    text: "From afar, Richard Browning — dressed in snug, all-black attire and with smoke billowing near his feet — resembled a mime standing over a smoldering fire. Then the scream of four miniature jet engines tore across the courtyard in front of the Museum of Science and Industry, Browning’s 5-foot-9 frame lifted off the ground and he — along with his 55-pound “jet suit” — hurtled toward 100 or so awestruck spectators Thursday morning. “It’s OK. You can take off the headphones now,” Browning said a few moments later, the air rippling behind him as he cut the engines, which resembled four black telescopic camera lenses jutting out from his wrists."

    text: "Augmented or mixed reality, which renders virtual images in a view of the real world, can be spectacular to experience. But it may be even more fun when you bring a friend. Researchers in the Microsoft lab of Jaron Lanier are experimenting with multi-person augmented reality, and the results of their work could help shape the way the technology is commercialized and used. Lanier was a pioneer of virtual and augmented, or mixed, reality in the 1980s."

The relaxed “Innovation U” networking and social event celebrated the Midwest as a premiere entrepreneurship pipeline, with short presentations from eleven startups, whether student-run, launched out of universities, or those that have tapped back into university pipelines. According to the state’s recent Innovation Index, this niche has tripled its efforts in the past five years and comprises two-thirds of all Illinois startups."

    text: "There’s wearable tech, and then there’s the device a team of University of Illinois at Chicago PHD students have created that’s capable of a lot more than surfing the web and checking your health stats. During a UIC human augmentics class Victor Mateevitsi, Brad Haggadone and Brian Kunzer were asked to do one thing: Make something that can see the invisible. What developed was SpiderSense, a wearable suit with 15 modules placed all around a person’s body that applies pressure when someone is approaching an object."

    text: "Brightening the eyes of kids and superhero fans alike, the SpiderSense suit created in UIC’s Electronic Visualization Lab is highlighted in a National Geographic Kids book. The suit, which allows users to sense obstacles without seeing them, was featured as “Wearable Tech” in National Geographic’s Weird But True! Ripped from the Headlines Summer 2014 edition. SpiderSense has seven sensor modules placed on the body: two on the wrists, two on the chest and one each on the back, shoulders and head. The sensors use echolocation — which bats have to navigate in the dark — and apply pressure when something is nearby."

In this case, Mr. Mateevitsi created a set of wearable sensors that allow hockey players to feel pressure when they approach a wall or an object-or when an object, say, a defender, approaches them. \"If someone is behind you, you will sense them,\" he says. Strictly a prototype, this \"SpiderSense\" suit won't make anyone a superhero, yet. But it could have many practical applications."

    text: "You can choose your clothes, but can you control them? A new line of clothing that incorporates tiny, flexible LEDs right into jackets and dresses could be the first fully controllable electronic clothing that’s ready for the shop rack. The collection, called Lüme, was shown last week at the International Symposium on Wearable Computers in Zurich, Switzerland. It consists of a bomber jacket, a tunic, and an open-backed dress – all of which have controllable LEDs built-in that can be controlled by a smartphone app. The LEDs are enmeshed in fabric so they don’t touch the wearer’s skin, and they shine out through several layers of fabric that diffuse the light for a softer glow."

    title: Virtual reality display lets fire crews see in blaze
    text: "When firefighters enter a burning building, they usually go in blind. Smoke often shrouds their view and it can be hard to know exactly where they are, or where the fire is. A virtual reality project called ProFiTex at the Vienna University of Technology in Austria is attempting to change that by giving firefighters a head-up display which helps them navigate in the dark. The system uses head-mounted infrared sensors that overlay surface temperatures onto the display, which also shows a 3D model of the surroundings created by a head-mounted depth camera. This gives firefighters an idea of how hot their surroundings are, whether it is safe to enter a room and the layout of the rooms in front of them."

    title: Virtual reality creates infinite maze in a single roomu
    text: "STEP into the labyrinth. Imagine physically wandering through the many rooms and corridors of an endless maze, never seeing the same place twice – but without actually leaving your living room. This is the promise of a new virtual reality (VR) system. It works by tracking the body and head movements of a person wearing a VR headset and guides them through endless sets of virtual spaces as they pace around within a real physical space. The trick is that, in the virtual world, the corridors and rooms are generated automatically as the walker moves to always fit inside the real space available. There is potentially no end to the environment, just like a huge video game."

A team of scientists at the University of Illinois at Chicago has created an extrasensory suit inspired by the Marvel superhero Spider-Man that allows its wearers to feel approaching danger. The getup, dubbed SpiderSense, is more of a wearable network of ultrasound sensors than an actual suit. But like the fictional Peter Parker's own superhuman \"spider-sense,\" it detects oncoming objects, obstacles and potential attackers in the vicinity and applies pressure to the skin, providing early warning."
