- title: "7th International Workshop on In Situ Visualization"
  description: "Large-scale HPC simulations with their inherent I/O bottleneck have made in situ visualization an essential approach for data analysis, although the idea of in situ visualization dates back to the golden era of coprocessing in the 1990s. In situ coupling of analysis and visualization to a live simulation circumvents writing raw data to disk for post-mortem analysis – an approach that is already inefficient for today’s very large simulation codes. Instead, with in situ visualization, data abstracts are generated that provide a much higher level of expressiveness per byte. Therefore, more details can be computed and stored for later analysis, providing more insight than traditional methods."

  description: "Large-scale HPC simulations with their inherent I/O bottleneck have made in situ visualization an essential approach for data analysis, although the idea of in situ visualization dates back to the golden era of coprocessing in the 1990s. In situ coupling of analysis and visualization to a live simulation circumvents writing raw data to disk for post-mortem analysis – an approach that is already inefficient for today’s very large simulation codes. Instead, with in situ visualization, data abstracts are generated that provide a much higher level of expressiveness per byte. Therefore, more details can be computed and stored for later analysis, providing more insight than traditional methods."

  description: "The considerable interest in the HPC community regarding in situ analysis and visualization is due to several factors. First is an I/O cost savings, where data is analyzed/visualized while being generated, without first storing to a file system. Second is the potential for increased accuracy, where fine temporal sampling of transient analysis might expose some complex behavior missed in coarse temporal sampling. Third is the ability to use all available resources, CPUs and accelerators, in the computation of analysis products."

ACM Interactive Surfaces and Spaces is the premier venue for research in the design, development, and use of new and emerging interactive surface technologies and interactive spaces. Łódź is the third-largest city in Poland. The city offers a vibrant atmosphere and an eclectic, multicultural heritage to explore. The conference will be a hybrid event. The in-person part of the event will take place at the EC1 - an nineteenth-century power plant turned into a science and meeting centre. We will make final decisions on the exact format of the conference in late summer 2021. We will ensure that anyone can effectively contribute to ISS regardless of what the circumstances in November will be. ISS will offer virtual attendance opportunities."
