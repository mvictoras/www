I hold a PhD from the Electronic Visualization Laboratory, University of Illinois at Chicago and am currently a Human-Computer Interaction Research Scientist at GN Advanced Science. I am focusing my research on exploring, designing and evaluating novel human augmentation techniques facilitated by technology. Aiming to overcome challenges of human computer interaction in the emerging technologies of wearable computers and human augmentation devices, and to improve quality of life for individuals with disabilities, I draw on a diverse set of skills, including scientific visualization, computer graphics, human computer interaction, electronics, sensors, fabrication and computer vision, in a field that is versed in Computer Science, Bioengineering, Psychology and Psychophysics.

I believe in ubiquitous technology’s potential to enhance the human experience, enabling faster non-biologically evolution as a species.

My life is all about:

* **Taking the unbeaten path.** It’s harder, but will make you do amazing things.
* **Using technology for good.** Now more than ever we have the opportunity to use it in order to elevate the human experience and improve our quality of life.
* **Exercising the body and the mind.** I play Ice Hockey. Ice hockey keeps me sane (I played for the Greek National Ice Hockey team and participcated in the World Championships), while my guitar relaxes me.
