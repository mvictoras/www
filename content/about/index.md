# Hi, I \'m Victor!
<h2 class="text-muted pb-3">I 'm a Computer Scientist at ANL</h2>

I design interactive visualizations of domain-specific high-resolution large-scale datasets, develop emerging technologies, create futuristic interfaces and interactions, and prototype next-generation hardware devices. In other words, I envision the technology 5-10 years down the road, and then I proceed to build it. Early in my career, I realized the endless possibilities of Computer Graphics and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Fascinated by the ways Computer Graphics can help understand complex multi-dimensional data, and by the ways HCI can help understand and enhance human activities and experiences, I decided to focus my academic and professional career on finding new ways to improve data discovery and analysis for domain scientists all over the world.

I have a background in Computer Science and hold a PhD from the {{< a link="Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL)" src="//www.evl.uic.edu" >}}, {{< a link="University of Illinois at Chicago" src="//www.uic.edu" >}}, where I spent my graduate years collaborating with multidisciplinary teams on various Human-Computer Interaction problems, and working on bleeding-edge technologies, like the {{< a link="CAVE2" src="https://youtu.be/d5XDbzy7vuE" >}} and {{< a link="SAGE2" src="https://youtu.be/ZHm6wdPP1RY" >}}.

I have been fortunate to have worked on super-exciting projects, at top-tier organizations, with the brightest people in the industry. From being {{< a link="selected" src="https://deadline.com/2013/06/academy-science-and-technology-council-names-2013-interns-524769/" >}} by the {{< a link="Science and Technology Council" src="https://www.oscars.org/learn/science-technology" >}} of the {{< a link="Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences" src="https://www.oscars.org" >}} to  intern for {{< a link="Pixar" src="https://www.pixar.com" >}}, working on the {{< a link="Universal Scene Description (USD)" src="https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/index.html" >}}; to spending a summer at {{< a link="DreamWorks" src="https://www.dreamworks.com" >}} animation, developing {{< a link="Premo" src="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2614106.2614123?download=true" >}}, the {{< a link="award-winning" src="https://www.oscars.org/sci-tech/ceremonies/2018" >}} animation platform behind Oscar-nominated movies, like {{< a link="How To Train Your Dragon 2" src="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1646971/" >}}; to researching {{< a link="social Mixed Reality" src="https://www.onmsft.com/news/microsoft-researchers-working-multi-person-mixed-reality-experiences" >}} at {{< a link="Microsoft Research" src="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1646971/" >}}, alongside father of VR, {{< a link="Jaron Lanier" src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier" >}}, I enjoy solving difficult problems in inter and multidisciplinary teams.

After graduating from {{< a link="EVL" src="https://www.evl.uic.edu" >}}, I co-founded {{< a link="SpatialCanvas" src="https://www.spatialcanvas.com" >}} with the vision of building the future of ARCloud, before joining {{< a link="GN Advanced Science" src="https://www.spatialcanvas.com" >}}, where I worked on next-generation audio solutions, inventing and prototyping Human-Computer Interaction tools, methodologies, and concepts. I currently hold a Computer Scientist position at the {{< a link="Argonne Leadership Computing Facility" src="https://www.alcf.anl.gov" >}} (ALCF), {{< a link="Argonne National Laboratory" src="https://www.anl.gov" >}} (ANL), working with the Visualization and Data Analytics team on visualizing large-scale datasets that have been simulated on the Supercomputer.

I draw on a diverse set of skills, including scientific visualization, computer graphics, human computer interaction, electronics, sensors, fabrication and computer vision.

### More facts about me
I play Ice Hockey üèí as long as I can remember. From 2006 - 2009 I was selected in the {{< a link="Greek National Ice Hockey Team" src="http://www.eurohockey.com/player/125505-viktor-mateevitsi.html" >}} and participated in the Division 3 IIHF World Championships. Today I play at Johnny's Adult Hockey League with the {{< a link="Centurions" src="https://pointstreak.com/players/players-team.html?teamid=624788&seasonid=19724"  >}}.
