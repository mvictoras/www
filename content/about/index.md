I develop emerging technologies, design futuristic interfaces and interactions, and prototype next-generation hardware devices. In other words, I envision the technology 5-10 years down the road, and then I proceed and build it. Early in my carreer, I realized that memorable and great experiences are due to well thought human-computer interaction, and that was something I decided to focus on. I am very passionate about designing technologies that improve the quality of life for all people, especially those with disabilities.
