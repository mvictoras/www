I first started building this page back in 2015, inspired by {{< a link="Chris Harrison" src="https://www.chrisharrison.net" >}} in an effort to keep my visitors up-to-date with my latest news and updates. But soon I realized that posting those brief and often frequent snippets online turned into a mini journal—a place reminiscent of past happenings, events and accomplishments. Check back here to keep up with my life and work: I’ll be updating this page as regularly as possible.
