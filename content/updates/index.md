I started writing mini-updates back in 2015, inspired by <a href="www.chrisharrison.net" target="_blank">Chris Harrison's</a> website. While initially I liked the idea of keeping my visitors up-to-date with my latest updates, over time, I realized that this list has become, in a way, a mini diary. It serves as a wy to step back, overview what I have accomplished, and reminiscence paste events and happenings. Due to my PhD priorities, I unfortunatelly was not a good update-keeper during 2017-2018, however I now plan to keep it updated as regularly as possible.
