During the Spring 2013 semester, I collaborated with UIC students Tom Ryba and LSU students Margaret Fink and Johnathan Stansbury to create a game for the class. Our team, the Mudbug Studios, create Futile, a space exploration game by Mudbug Studios that takes place trillions of years from today.

The player initially starts as a man-made satellite and needs to grow by collecting items of his size. As player grows, he slowly becomes a satellite, planet, then a star and finally a galaxy.

Did I mention that the universe is in an unstable state and that you need to save it! Can you do it?
