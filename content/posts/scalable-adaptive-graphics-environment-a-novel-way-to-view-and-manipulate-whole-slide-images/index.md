The Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment (SAGE) was developed at the University of Illinois at Chicagoâ€™s (UIC) Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) to facilitate collaborative efforts that require the sharing of data-intensive information for analysis. SAGE is a cross-platform, community-driven, open-source visualization and collaboration tool that enables users to access, display, and share a variety of data-intensive information, in a variety of resolutions and format, from multiple sources, on tiled display walls of arbitrary size. SAGE walls have had the ability to display digital-cinema animations, high resolution images, high-definition video-conferences, presentation slides, documents, spreadsheets, and computer screens; however, there was no way to display and manipulate histologic whole-slide images (WSIs). Our desire was to create a tool to permit the importation, display, and manipulation of WSI in the SAGE environment.
