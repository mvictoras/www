My good friend and teammate George Kouleles was visiting me in Chicago, so we decided to hit the rink and shoot some pucks together. John Koufis, friend and teammate, joined us for the late rat-hockey session where we had a lot of fun! It is nice to see old friends and  blow the steam off on the ice. John is with the black Jersey, George with the blue and I am with the blue Jokerit one.
