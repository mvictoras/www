OmegaDesk is a device that allows for seamless interaction between
  
2D and 3D content. In order to develop this hybrid device, a new form of Operating
  
System is needed to manage and display heterogeneous content. In this
  
paper we address the hardware and software requirements for such a system, as
  
well as challenges. A set of heterogeneous applications has been successfully
  
developed on OmegaDesk. They allowed us to develop a set of guidelines to
  
drive future investigations into 2D/3D hybridized viewing and interaction.
