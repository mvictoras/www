After a few years trying to learn guitar by myself, which resulted in having a dusted guitar on the wall, I decided to join a real music school and learn from the experts. I joined the <a href="http://www.oldtownschool.org/" target="_blank">Old Town School of Folk Music</a> in January 2014 and it is the best decision I have ever made. The instructor, <a href="http://www.oldtownschool.org/teachers/cathy-norden/" target="_blank">Cathy Norden</a> is stellar with a great attitude, patience and love for music and her students! During the 8-week session, we learned the F, Dm & Bm chords, a few bass runs in keys A, C, D, E, G, arpeggios in 4/4, 3/4 & 6/8 time, simple scale knowledge, slash chords and bass notes on strings E, A, D and a developing friendship with the capo. For the end of our session, we decided to sing the old time classic &#8220;Hotel California&#8221;. Enjoy!
