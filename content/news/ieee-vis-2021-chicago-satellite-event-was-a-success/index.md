Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the {{< a src="http://ieeevis.org/year/2021/welcome" link="IEEE VIS 2021" >}} conference will be virtual. As a result, the VIS organization committee has encouraged the organization of local satellite events, to fill the gap of in-person experiences and allow the local academic and professional VIS communities to network, come together, and exchange ideas.

We gathered on the same day as the VIS Keynote (Tuesday, October 26) at the {{< a src="https://www.evl.uic.edu" link="Electronic Visualization Laboratory" >}} (EVL). After watching the days' VIS program, {{< a src="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/affiliated/keahey-alan.html" link="Dr. Alan Keahey" >}}, Vice President for Data Science Visualization at {{< a src="https://www.epsilon.com/us" link="Epsilon" >}}, kicked off our own local program, with his talk "Visualizing the Digital Marketing Ecosystem". We then continued with 10 students from local colleges (NIU, UIC, Northwestern) presenting their research work with a lightning talk. At the end of a very engaging and interesting day, we continued at Athena restaurant to continue the discussion over food and drinks. Overall, a great day!
