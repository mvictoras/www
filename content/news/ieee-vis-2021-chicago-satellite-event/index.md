Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the {{< a src="http://ieeevis.org/year/2021/welcome" link="IEEE VIS 2021" >}} conference will be virtual. As a result, the VIS organization committee has encouraged the organization of local satellite events, to fill the gap of in-person experiences and allow the local academic and professional VIS communities to network, come together, and exchange ideas.

The satellite program will be held on the same day as the VIS Keynote (Tuesday, October 26) and will take place at the {{< a src="https://www.evl.uic.edu" link="Electronic Visualization Laboratory" >}} (EVL). The event will be divided into two parts, a virtual watch party of the official VIS 2021 program, followed by our local program, which will include a keynote talk (Visualizing the Digital Marketing Ecosystem) by {{< a src="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/affiliated/keahey-alan.html" link="Dr. Alan Keahey" >}}. 

I will be co-chairing the event with {{< a src="https://fmiranda.me" link="Fabio Miranda" >}}, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the {{< a src="https://www.uic.edu" link="University of Illinois at Chicago" >}} (UIC). I would also like to thank {{< a src="https://www.anl.gov/profile/michael-e-papka" link="Michael E. Papka">}}  for assisting as a mentor/advisor.

If you would like to attend, visit our {{< a src="https://www.evl.uic.edu/vis-chicago/" link="event page" >}} and register! Seats are very limited. Hope to see you all!
