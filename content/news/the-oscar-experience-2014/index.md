During the Summer 2013, I interned for the <a href="http://www.oscars.org" target="_blank">Academy of the Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a>&#8216; <a href="http://www.oscars.org/learn/science-technology" target="_blank">Sci-Tech Council</a>, which got me to a position at <a href="http://www.pixar.com" target="_blank">Pixar Animation Studios</a>, and one of the perks as an Academy intern, was a seat at the Oscar&#8217;s Bleachers! The ceremony was fantastic and it is so weird to see all the movie stars at such a close distance. The red carpet was great, but also a lot smaller than what I imagined (and compared to how it looks on the TV).
