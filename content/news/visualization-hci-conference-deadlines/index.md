To keep track of the VIS/HCI conferences I was searching for a curated list by other researchers/universities, but I found none. I knew that the AI community has a {{< a src="https://aideadlin.es/?sub=CV,NLP,DM,SP,ML,RO" link="similar list" >}}, so I decided to build my [own](/vis-deadlines).

If you are using it and find it useful, give me a shoutout on {{< a src="https://twitter.com/mvictoras" link="Twitter" >}}! I would also love to hear your comments/feedback/thoughts. Let me know if there is any conference you would like to see on this list!

## Features
