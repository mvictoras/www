For the 2012 Spring Semester I registered with the Computational Ecology class taught by <a href="http://compbio.cs.uic.edu/~tanya/" target="_blank">Tanya Berger-Wolf</a>, which got me to the <a href="http://www.mpala.org" target="_blank">Mpala Research Center and Wildlife Foundation</a> at Mpala, Kenya. The class was co-taught with Princeton Professors <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~dir/" target="_blank">Dan Rubenstein</a> and <a href="http://icouzin.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Iain Couzin</a>, on the  Kenyan Savannah. For my class project, I studied acacia tree ants (which bite!), examining four different ant species that have a symbiotic relationship with the acacia tree. Working with Princeton biologists, we collected data about the species and number of ants on a tree colony and created visualizations to map the colony and help ecologists analyze the data.

More pictures to come.
