In late 2017 I was approached by {{< a src="https://www.msichicago.org/press/media-requests/meet-our-experts/kathleen-mccarthy/" link="Kathleen McCarthy" >}},
director of collections and head curator at Chicago's {{< a src="https://www.msichicago.org" link="Museum of Science and Industry" >}}, for an exciting and
ambitious project: the first-ever exhibit dedicated to wearable technology. Kathleen's vision was to give to the public a sneak peek of the future of
wearable technologies. From smart clothing, to devices designed to extend the human bodyâ€™s capabilities, to wearables that make us healthier, stronger and safer.

During our initial meeting we discussed showcasing the various SpiderSense prototypes as well as an interactive piece, where users will be
allowed---for the first time---to experience SpiderSense and navigate using only their skin! The ideas of having an interactive piece at the museum was very
exhilerating to me because, as a researcher, oftentimes our inventions do not break out of the professional and academic circles. This was a great opportunity
to showcase my work---in one of the largest science museums in the world--- and allow (hopefully) millions of people to interact with it.

We partnered up with {{< a src="https://www.quantumxpr.com" link="Quantum XPR" >}}, a company that has expertize in building interactive museum pieces that can withstand
the "abuse" of time and millions of people, and designed a new vest that can be quickly worn/taken off and ideal for a museum environment.

You can experience SpiderSense at the {{< a src="https://www.msichicago.org/explore/whats-here/exhibits/wired-to-wear/" link="Wired to Wear" >}} exhibit,
at the {{< a src="https://www.msichicago.org" link="Museum of Science and Industry" >}}. If you go, please share with me your experience through your
favorite social network. Would be thrilled to chat with you and answer any questions!
