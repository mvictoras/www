During the 2014 Fall Semester I volunteered with <a href="http://www.sparkprogram.org/" target="_blank">SPARK</a>, a nonprofit organization that aims to provide life-changing apprenticeships to youth in underserved communities across the United States. Working with graduate student Alessandro Febretti I co-mentoredÂ Dexter Wells and Glen Poole from Legacy Charter School. After 10 weeks of hard work, the students developed a slingshot game for the CAVE2, using the Arduino and omegalib VR platform.
