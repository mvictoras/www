During the 2013 Spring Semester I volunteered with <a href="http://www.sparkprogram.org/" target="_blank">SPARK</a>, a nonprofit organization that aims to provide life-changing apprenticeships to youth in underserved communities across the United States. Working with graduate students Alessandro Febretti, Khairi Reda and Galen Thomas-Ramos, we co-mentored Antwan McBee, Andrew Lewis and Joshua Gartley from the Irvin C. Mollison Elementary. After 10 weeks of hard work, the students developed a Fruit-Ninja game for the CAVE2.
